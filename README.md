Micrometeoroid Impact Energy Harvesting

Overview

This work investigates the possibility of it being used to help process some of the energy content on a series of exploratory flights (conceptual spacecraft shielding systems section) and instead generate some useful quantities rather than wasting everything.

Problem

Micrometeoroids traveling at very high speeds constantly bombard spacecraft.

Normally their kinetic energy is absorbed/dissipated in destructive work and heat.

Concept

The proposed system includes a multiple layer protective structure:

Outer sacrificial impact layer

Intermediate conversion layer (mechanical to electrical and to heat).

Inner structural protection layer

D) a portion of the kinetic energy can be transformed to useful electrical power and heat.

Physics Intuition

The kinetic energy of a micro-meteoroid is expressed as:

E = 1/2 m v^2

Not to extract full energy but to recover some of the wasted energy that is not otherwise used.

Status

Early-stage conceptual idea under development.
